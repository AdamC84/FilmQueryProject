## FilmQuery Project
#### Skill Distillery Homework - week 6

### Overview
The Film Query project uses a mySQL database with fourteen different tables utilizing Java Database Connectivity API. It uses Java code that utilizes Object-Relational Mapping  and nested retrieval to pull data to the user using SQL statements. The user can query for films by film id's and will get a full description of the film's fields. It queries on Actor's id's as well,  retrieving the Actor's id, first name, and last name. The program can also retrieve a films description by a keyword search the will search on the "Title" and the "description" of the film.

### Lessons learned
This whole week of this subject has been a really fun topic to learn. I feel like this really connected a lot of the dots of the program. I feel like I really understood a lot of the topic. I do well with programming and statements that has rules to follow. I do like thinking out of the box, but the SQL statements and where the data was and going was very easy to comprehend for me. Unfortunately I still struggled with some of the if statements and getting back the correct data that I wanted. I also had some problems with my catch block where if it got invalid input it would go into an infinite loop. I ended up putting a label on my do loop and breaking out of it if there was an invalid input entered.
